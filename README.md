 - Linear/Final_Linear_Reg.ipynb: analysis of whether or not linear regression could be a potential model for translation of braint issues
 - CycleGANs/mri2sos/patches/create_dataloader.ipynb: used for creating the datasets for each tissue
 - CycleGANs/mri2sos/patches/mri2sos_v2.ipynb: used for training of the model by patches. Some examples of results and evaluation
 - CycleGANs/mri2sos/patches/mri2sos_eval.ipynb: used for evaluation of the models
 - CycleGANs/mri2sos/full_slices/create_dataloader.py: used for creating datasets
 - CycleGANs/mri2sos/full_slices/mri2sos_v3.py: used for training model
 - CycleGANs/mri2sos/full_slices/mri2sos_eval.py: evaluation of model performance
