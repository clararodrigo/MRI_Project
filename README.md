# MRI_Project

This is the code used throughout my Masters project on I2I translation. Welcome!!

Code relating to the Planning Report (17/01/2022):
 - Basic Exploration/Final_Linear_Reg.ipynb : the analysis of whether or not linear regression could be applied to the brain effectively
 - CycleGANs/Horse2Zebra : the code where the cycleGAN is built for translation in the horse2zebra dataset. This is a replication of [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593) paper 

Ongoing:
 - CycleGANs/mri2sos-patches.ipynb: due to GPU limitations, I am training the model in 64x64 patches of the images. This is less computationally expensive but will allow gauging whether the model would work with bigger images.
